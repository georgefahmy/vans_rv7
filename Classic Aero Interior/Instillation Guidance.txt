1: I lay the seating area carpet in the plane to determine where I'm going to drill holes in the floor for the Velcoins. I do this because I like to drill any holes in the floor pans while there out of the plane.  Once I have all of those marked I remove the floor pans and install the first piece from the Side Panel instructions. This is also the time to install the pushrod boots if you have them.

2: Once the floor pans are put back in, I drill the holes for the armrests using the provided template. I then temporarily install the armrests. This is useful when installing the seats.

3: I follow all of the instructions for installing the seats with the armrest in place to insure clearance. Once finished I remove the seats  and armrests from the plane.

4: This is where I usually install all of the carpet. It must be put in before any of the lower side panels. One tip for the front carpet, once you have the foam pads installed , cover them with some of the plastic bags that were used to package your interior. Position the carpet over the top of the bags, once you have the carpet in place pull the bags out. This makes it much easier than fighting with the Velcro to position the carpet.

5: Now install all of the side panels. Then clean up any metal shavings from drilling

6: Put the seats back in the plane.
